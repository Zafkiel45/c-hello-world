## Symbolic Constants

I learned about Symbolic Constants. A way to improve readibility for "magical numbers". 
A value dropped without a name is a bad practice, because the readibility will be poor for future readers.

Conventionally, the `symbolic constants` are wrote in uppercase. It cannot have a semicolon in the end of line. 

When the compile finds a name occurence for some `symbolic constants`, the name will be subistuted by the value associated to name. 

Example symbolic contants:

```c
#define FAVORITE_ANIME "Sousou no Frieren"
#define FAVORITE_GAME  "Darksouls Remastered" 
#define FAVORITE_MANGA "Vagabond" 
```
